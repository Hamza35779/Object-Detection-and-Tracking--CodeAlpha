# Object Detection and Tracking System

A real-time object detection and tracking application built with React, TypeScript, and TensorFlow.js. This system uses computer vision algorithms to detect and track objects in real-time through camera feeds.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Uses TensorFlow.js for browser-based object detection
- **Object Tracking**: Implements tracking algorithms to follow objects across frames
- **Live Camera Integration**: Direct camera feed processing
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and detection statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI built with React and Tailwind CSS
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety and modern development experience

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **ML/AI**: TensorFlow.js
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Camera API**: WebRTC/MediaDevices API
- **Object Detection**: Pre-trained TensorFlow.js models
